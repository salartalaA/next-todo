<h1 align="center">An Improved version of react-todo :]</h1>

It's a simple todo-list with login system that you can create a user and add a todo or remove it

### How to run the project

Before anything, you must install node_modules for dependencies & import the todo_db.sql to your mysql db

If you don't know how, check this out:

You can open up the terminal using Ctrl + Shift + ` shortcut in VS Code

Then type:

```bash
npm i

```

Then:

```bash
npm run nodeback

```
to run the backend (That's made using express JS)

after that, you will run the front part of the project using:

``` bash
npm run dev

```

So! The project will start at localhost:3000 on your browser!

Enjoy and feel free :]
